# Artificial Intelligence Workshop

An Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision workshop addressed to high-school and undergraduate students.
The workshop consists of a slideshow, to show the foundations of machine learning and deep learning, and then a few tutorials
related to the first steps into Deep Learning.

## Content

In this workshop, up to this moment, you will find classification tasks, as follows:

* MNIST classification.
* Fashion MNIST classification.
* Flowers classification.

The first tutorial for students who are seeing learning algorithms for the first time, should be starting off MNIST classification to learn about hyperparameters and interact with the data. 
Then, Fashion MNIST should be a further step as to learn about a few layers used in neural networks.
Finally, the flowers classification tutorial will ask the students to think of a possible archiecture,
as well as teach them about overfitting and data augmentation.

### Demonstration

The instructor shall do a demonstration to talk about object detection using YOLOv5.

#### Usage

To perform the demo, it is as simple as running the inference example in the YOLOv5 repoistory; using the `detect.py` file.

## Notebook usage

The tutorial should be given in ![Google Colab](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/84f0493939e0c4de4e6dbe113251b4bfb5353e57134ffd9fcab6b8714514d4d1/68747470733a2f2f636f6c61622e72657365617263682e676f6f676c652e636f6d2f6173736574732f636f6c61622d62616467652e737667). 
The purpose of this repository is only to version the notebooks.

The instructor shall ask the students to create a Google account, if they don't have it already.
After that, the instructor will share the notebooks by sending a link with `view` permission only, so each student can make a copy of
the notebook and use it as they wish, without disrupting the originals.
